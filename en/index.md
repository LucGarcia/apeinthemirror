# How to live a good life: the basics


In the last thousands of years, us humans have managed to explore the world, build cities, develop unimaginable technologies, grow our population exponentially and eliminate most threats to the survival of our species. You could say we are doing quite well.

What we never learned, though, is how to live a good life. For that, we still rely in religions and philosophies created more than two thousand years ago. And, with mental illnesses and existential anxiety growing as fast as our populations, we seem to be doing worse with time rather than better.

The "good life problem" forces us to take a deep look at our own nature. What makes a good life will be determined by what we are and what we need.

Part of the problem is that we care more for who we are than for what we are. All these years, we have been creating an image of ourselves that is not quite realistic. We have been telling stories of how special, unique, heroic and cool we are. And we continue to do so. We create stories about superhumans and, when we do not measure up to them, we feel that we are not enough.

Not great for self esteem, right?

Instead of trying to elevate ourselves to the legends that we create, maybe we should start by eating a generous serving of humble pie. The truth is, we know what we are. Our experts (biologists, geneticists, taxonomists) have been telling us for years: we are apes. We are monkeys.

And a monkey needs a monkey life.

Let's talk about that.
